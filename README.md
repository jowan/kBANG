This is an old project I did after my MA in 2006.
It is a continuation of the hardware and software I developed on the MA for Gameboy Original.

Some recordings are on sound cloud here: https://soundcloud.com/8bitplateau/sets/old-gameboy-drum-machine-recordings

It is a custom cartridge (origrina design by (will find name asap)) running a Drum machine ROM, where the drum kicks triggered a series of solenoids placed on different surfaces for different noises.

I set up a demo table and invited people to play with it at various events with koept.net
